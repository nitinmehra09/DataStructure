# 🚀 Data Structures in C ✨

Hi! 👋 I'm currently learning data structures in C, and this repository documents my journey. Here, you'll find my implementations of fundamental concepts like stacks, queues, linked lists, and more. It's a work in progress, so I'm constantly adding new features and improving existing ones. Whether you're a fellow student, a beginner, or just curious, feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or learn alongside me!

This repo is all about learning by doing. I'm building everything from scratch to understand the core concepts better. From basic operations like push/pop in stacks to traversing circular linked lists, each implementation is a step forward in my learning journey. I believe in collaborative growth, so your feedback and contributions are always welcome!

If you're also learning data structures or want to practice, this is a great place to start. Let's grow together, build a strong foundation, and make this journey fun and productive! 🌱💻🚀

Happy coding! 💻✨
